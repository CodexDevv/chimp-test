# Chimp Test inspired by [HumanBenchmark's Chimp Test](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/chimp)

This is a test of working memory, made famous by a study that found that chimpanzees consistently outperform humans on this task.

In the study, the chimps consistently outperformed humans, and some chimps were able to remember 9 digits over 90% of the time.

This test is a variant of that concept, that gets increasingly difficult every turn, starting at 4 digits, and adding one every turn. If you pass a level, the number increases. If you fail, the game is over.
